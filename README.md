# feraw

  feraw is a rawer preprocessor, it allows you to write a minimal c-like code that transpiles to rawer code.

  feraw is currently written in javascript, and it is a single file `feraw.js` that works anywhere with es2015(maybe es2020?) support.

# Usage

  pass a string to feraw_compile and it will return a rawer code string, that simple.
