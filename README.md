# feraw

  feraw is a bruter-representation preprocessor, it allows you to write a very little abstracted minimal stack-oriented c-like code that transpiles to bruter-representation.

  feraw is currently written in javascript, and it is a single file `feraw.js`.

# Usage

  pass a string to feraw_compile and it will return a string containing a bruter-representation, that simple.
